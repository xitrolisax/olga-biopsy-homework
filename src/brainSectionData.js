      "The eyes are sensory organs that detect light and send visual information to the brain through the optic nerve. They play a huge role in vision and spatial awareness. Depending on your perception, you either see lifeless, gray tones or intriguing, deep shades of ebonite that keep things interesting.",

    title: "Nerves",
    content:
      "Nerves are bundles of axons that carry signals between the brain, spinal cord, and the rest of the body. They’re essential for everything sensory and motor. Fun fact: the longest axon in your body is part of the sciatic nerve and can be about a meter long. If you accidentally pinch it, let’s just say your mood won’t thank you for it. Also, anything that messes with the nervous system—like sleep deprivation, too much caffeine, or constant stimulation—makes you prone to stress, depression, and even symptoms resembling ADHD. The central nervous system also shapes your temperament, so it’s not something you want to upset.",

    content:
      "The globus pallidus is part of the basal ganglia system, which regulates voluntary movement. The basal ganglia are like control hubs for processing movement and telling your muscles what to do. For instance, if someone spills a drink heading your way, the basal ganglia help you react and jump out of the way. When this system has problems, it can lead to issues like ADHD, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease, or even depression. It’s an important player in both physical and mental health.",

    title: "Gyrus",
    content:
      "A gyrus is a ridge on the surface of the brain that increases its processing power by creating more space for neurons. When things go wrong, particularly in the anterior cingulate gyrus, it can contribute to mood disorders like depression and anxiety, as well as emotional regulation issues seen in conditions like bipolar disorder. It’s small, but it packs a punch when it comes to emotions.",

    title: "Limbic System",
    content:
      "The limbic system is your brain’s emotional center. It manages emotions like fear, anger, and happiness, along with basic drives like hunger and sexual desire. It’s made up of three main parts: the amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus. The amygdala handles emotional reactions to things like danger or excitement, marking certain memories as more emotionally significant. The hippocampus turns your experiences into memories, so you can remember the details later. The thalamus takes sensory information from your eyes, ears, and other senses and helps you process everything in the moment. Together, they make sure you feel, remember, and react appropriately in any situation.",

    id: "thalamus",
    title: "Thalamus",
    content:
      "The thalamus acts like a relay station, sending sensory information to the right parts of the brain for processing. It’s also involved in motor control and plays a key role in maintaining consciousness. Think of it as the brain’s air traffic controller, keeping everything running smoothly.",

    content:
      "The brainstem is a small but mighty area at the base of your brain. It keeps you alive by regulating essential functions like breathing, blood pressure, and body temperature. It’s also home to neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are critical for motivation and mood. If the brainstem takes a hit, it can throw your whole system off balance, leaving you unmotivated and drained of interest.",

    title: "Encephalon",
    content:
      "The brain is divided into two hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum, and further split into four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. The frontal lobe is all about decision-making, personality, and emotional control—problems here can lead to mood swings and impulsivity. The parietal lobe processes sensory information and helps you interpret social and emotional cues. The temporal lobe connects to memory and emotional regulation, and the occipital lobe, while focused on vision, can indirectly impact mood through how visual information is perceived. It’s a team effort.",

    title: "Cerebellum",
    content:
      "The cerebellum, or “little brain,” coordinates your movements and keeps you balanced. It also helps match sensory input with motor actions, like writing or walking. But it’s not just about movement—the cerebellum also supports planning, learning, and even emotional regulation. It’s like a multitasking powerhouse tucked in the back of your head.",

    title: "Reticular Formation",
    content:
      "The reticular formation is a network in the brainstem that controls arousal, sleep, and attention. It’s essential for maintaining balance between being awake, resting, and managing stress—all of which are crucial for a stable mood. A healthy reticular formation keeps you alert but not overwhelmed, making life feel just right.",
