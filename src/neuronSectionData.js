    content:
      "The axon is the neuron’s communication pathway, transmitting electrical signals (action potentials) from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands. It’s often covered by a myelin sheath, which speeds up signal transmission.",

    title: "Dendrites",
    content:
      "These are the dendrites of the neuron, which function as the primary receivers of incoming signals from other neurons. They transfer this information to the cell body, where it is processed and passed on to other parts of the nervous system.",

    title: "Nucleus",
    content:
      "This represents the nucleus of the neuron, which serves as the control center of the cell. It houses the neuron’s genetic material (DNA) and oversees key processes such as protein synthesis and cell repair, ensuring the neuron functions efficiently.",

    title: "Myelin Sheaths",
    content:
      "Myelin serves as insulation, allowing electrical signals to travel faster along the axon. It also protects the axon and helps conserve the neuron's energy by enabling impulses to 'jump' between gaps called the Nodes of Ranvier, instead of traveling continuously.",
